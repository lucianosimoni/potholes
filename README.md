## Desktop App

### Desktop MVP

- Implement `Map` page using _Google Maps_ library;
- Create a `navigation` somewhere
- Have the `Add button` that takes user to the `form page`;
- Have a `Local DB` with a basic _json_ info structure for the Markers (holes) to be rendered in the map later.

### V2 Map style update

- Create the Markers (`Holes`) on the map;
- Add custom `map style`;
- Add `Icon to Markers`

### V3 Markers update

- Implement Marker `Info` when pressed that shows its Images;
- Make the `form page` functional sending info to `Local DB` and `rendering new marker` on _Map_

### V4 Reports update

- Create `Reports` page;
- `Reports` page shows
  - All Potholes (maybe per city?),
  - Daily frequency of reports,
  - Total of Potholes registered in the App.

### V5 Help and About pages

- Create `Help` page with basic FAQs about App
- Create `About` page that talks about Dev

### V6 User Update

- Create the `user info` on the Database
- Create a component to `render user info` like a profile page

## Mobile App

### Mobile MVP
